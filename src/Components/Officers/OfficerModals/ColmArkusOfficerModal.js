    <h1>Hi, I'm Colm.</h1>
      <p>I am an avid gamer, playing most new games as they come out but I always come back to FFXIV.  I'm always interested in running content, and I'm happy to lend a hand to anyone who needs it when I'm around.  My main role is tanking, primarily as a paladin, but I know a little bit about everything.  If you need help or advice, feel free to hit me up, if I don't know how to help you I do know someone who can.  I follow the gaming industry pretty heavily, but I also find time to watch anime or other shows I'm interested in.  I live in Alabama, and I go to anime and gaming conventions in my area.</p>
